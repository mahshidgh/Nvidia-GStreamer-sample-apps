# Nvidia GStreamer Pipelines Repository

Welcome to the Nvidia GStreamer Pipelines repository! This project aims to provide a collection of GStreamer pipelines optimized for Nvidia GPUs using the DeepStream SDK 6.2. These pipelines are designed to accelerate various video processing tasks, making it easier for developers to work with Nvidia-powered applications.

## What is Nvidia GStreamer?

[Nvidia GStreamer](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk) is a framework that leverages the power of Nvidia GPUs for video and multimedia processing. It combines the flexibility of GStreamer, a widely-used open-source multimedia framework, with Nvidia's hardware acceleration capabilities. The result is a high-performance solution for tasks such as video decoding, inference with deep learning models, object tracking, and more.

## Installation Requirements

To use the Nvidia GStreamer pipelines in this repository, you'll need to set up the following prerequisites:

1. **DeepStream SDK 6.2**: You must have the DeepStream SDK 6.2 installed on your system. This SDK provides the necessary tools and libraries to enable hardware-accelerated video processing. You can download it from the [Nvidia Developer Website](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk).

2. **Nvidia GPU**: Ensure that you have an Nvidia GPU that is compatible with DeepStream and CUDA. Check the DeepStream documentation for a list of supported GPUs.

3. **Operating System**: The Nvidia GStreamer pipelines are typically designed to work on Linux-based systems, so make sure you have a supported Linux distribution installed.
